## 1. International Client Engagement Model

### 1.1 Delivery Capability
Clyros Tech is delivery-ready for international engagements from India-based distributed teams. We support clients in:
- United States (all timezones)
- Europe (UK, EU member states)
- Asia-Pacific markets
- Middle East
- Other international markets assessed on case-by-case basis

### 1.2 Engagement Prerequisites
Before committing to international engagements, we evaluate:
- Regulatory environment and compliance requirements
- Contractual and legal framework complexity
- Timezone overlap feasibility and client expectations
- Data residency and cross-border data transfer requirements
- Client acceptance of India-based delivery model

### 1.3 No-Physical-Office Model
Clyros Tech does NOT maintain:
- Physical offices in client countries
- Local legal entities (except India)
- Local payroll or employment structures

We deliver through distributed teams with occasional on-site travel when required. This must be clearly communicated during sales discussions.

## 2. Contracting & Jurisdiction Considerations

### 2.1 Contracting Entities
**Primary:** Clyros Tech Private Limited (India entity)

For US clients requiring US-based legal entity, we can engage through:
- Direct contract with Indian entity (most common)
- Partnership with US-based prime contractor (subcontractor model)
- Evaluation of US LLC formation (future consideration, executive approval required)

### 2.2 Contract Review Requirements
All international contracts must be reviewed by:
1. Delivery Leadership (technical feasibility, resource availability)
2. Legal Counsel (contract terms, liability, IP, jurisdiction)
3. Executive Leadership (commercial terms, strategic fit)

### 2.3 Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

**United States:**
- State tax nexus considerations if significant on-site presence
- W-9 documentation for US client procurement
- Professional liability insurance (maintain current coverage)
- Export control compliance (ITAR, EAR for government/defense)

**Europe:**
- VAT registration may be required for certain service types
- GDPR compliance and data processing agreements mandatory
- Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfer from EEA
- Language: contracts in English; client-facing materials in English unless specified

**Other Markets:**
- Jurisdiction-specific risk assessment before commitment
- Local regulatory and tax consultation as needed

## 3. Data Residency Awareness

### 3.1 Data Transfer Scenarios

**Scenario A: Client Data Remains in Client Infrastructure**
- Engineers access client systems remotely (VPN, bastion hosts)
- Data does not egress client-controlled environment
- Minimal data protection complexity
- Most common for cloud-based clients (AWS, Azure, GCP)

**Scenario B: Data Transferred to Clyros Tech Environment**
- Requires explicit data processing agreements
- Appropriate safeguards per regulatory context (SCCs, BAAs)
- Data encryption, access controls, audit logging
- Less common; only when technically necessary

**Scenario C: Data Resides in Specific Geographic Regions**
- Configure client cloud infrastructure to required regions (eg US East, EU West)
- Clyros Tech engineers access remotely without data movement
- Client retains data residency control

### 3.2 Regulatory Framework Alignment

**GDPR (Europe):**
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) required
- Standard Contractual Clauses for EU-to-India data transfer
- Technical and organizational measures documentation
- Subprocessor disclosure (if applicable)
- Right to audit provisions

**HIPAA (US Healthcare):**
- Business Associate Agreement (BAA) before PHI access
- HIPAA Security Rule safeguards implementation
- Breach notification procedures
- Audit and compliance documentation

**Other Frameworks:**
- Assessed based on client jurisdiction and data types
- Legal counsel engaged for complex regulatory contexts

## 4. Delivery Risk Management

### 4.1 Timezone Challenges
**Risk:** Insufficient overlap for real-time collaboration  
**Mitigation:**
- Set clear expectations during sales process
- Structure teams to provide required overlap hours
- Use asynchronous collaboration for non-critical tasks
- Schedule key meetings during overlap windows
- Extended hours coverage for production support (with appropriate staffing)

### 4.2 Cultural and Communication Differences
**Risk:** Misalignment in communication styles, expectations, work culture  
**Mitigation:**
- Training for teams on cross-cultural communication
- Explicit documentation of expectations and norms
- Regular check-ins to surface and address misalignments
- Senior leadership involvement in critical client interactions

### 4.3 Travel and On-Site Requirements
**Risk:** Unexpected on-site work requirements strain budget or availability  
**Mitigation:**
- Clarify on-site expectations during contracting
- Build travel budget into engagement pricing
- Maintain passports and visa readiness for key personnel
- Plan on-site visits strategically (kickoffs, deployments, knowledge transfer)

### 4.4 Regulatory and Compliance Complexity
**Risk:** Unforeseen regulatory requirements or compliance gaps  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive regulatory assessment before engagement start
- Legal counsel consultation for complex jurisdictions
- Conservative commitments regarding compliance capabilities
- Transparent communication about limitations

### 4.5 Payment and Currency
**Risk:** International payment delays, currency fluctuations, tax complications  
**Mitigation:**
- Establish clear payment terms in contracts
- Invoice in USD or EUR for international clients (or other agreed currency)
- Payment methods: wire transfer, ACH (US), other mutually agreed
- Net 30 standard; other terms negotiable

## 5. Escalation and Resolution Mechanisms

### 5.1 Client-Facing Escalation Path

**Level 1: Technical Lead / Engineering Manager**
- Technical issues, bugs, clarifications
- Response: Within business day (IST hours)

**Level 2: Delivery Manager / Program Lead**
- Schedule, scope, resource concerns
- Response: Within 4 business hours (IST hours)

**Level 3: Executive Leadership**
- Critical issues, contractual disputes, strategic concerns
- Response: Within 2 business hours for critical issues; 1 business day for non-critical

### 5.2 Internal Escalation Triggers
Issues that require immediate executive escalation:
- Client threatens contract termination
- Security incident involving client data
- Regulatory violation or compliance breach
- Legal dispute or threatened litigation
- Payment disputes exceeding 30 days
- Resource or delivery capability crisis

### 5.3 Communication Protocols for International Clients

**Business Hours:**
- IST business hours: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM India Standard Time
- Email monitored during IST hours; out-of-hours for urgent issues
- Phone/video calls scheduled during timezone overlap windows

**Emergency Contacts:**
- Provided to clients at engagement start
- Limited to critical production incidents or security events
- Executive leadership reachable for true emergencies

**Response Time Expectations:**
- Defined in engagement agreements (no blanket SLAs)
- Vary based on criticality and client timezone
- Conservative commitments that account for timezone differences
