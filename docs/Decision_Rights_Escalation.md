## Decision Rights & Escalation Framework

**Document Classification:** Internal Only – Operational  
**Audience:** Executive Leadership, Delivery Managers, Team Leads, Engineers  
**Purpose:** Define who decides what, when to escalate, and how to resolve conflicts  
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Document Purpose

This document defines Clyros Tech's decision rights and escalation framework: who has authority to make which decisions, when to escalate, and how conflicts are resolved. It provides:
- Decision categories and authority levels
- Escalation triggers and process
- Resolution timelines and expectations
- Documentation requirements

**This document is NOT:**
- A substitute for judgment and collaboration
- A rigid hierarchy that prevents communication
- A blame framework (escalation is expected, not failure)
- External-facing or client-visible

---

## Decision Rights Philosophy

### Principles

**1. Authority Matches Responsibility**
- Those accountable for outcomes have authority to make decisions
- Decision rights are clear (no ambiguity about who decides)
- Authority is delegated to lowest appropriate level (not centralized unnecessarily)

**2. Escalation is Expected, Not Failure**
- Escalation is a tool for resolving issues beyond current authority or expertise
- Escalate early when decision requires higher authority or broader context
- No penalty for escalating; penalty for hiding problems

**3. Transparency Over Secrecy**
- Decisions are documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders
- Rationale for decisions is explained (not just "because I said so")
- Dissenting views are heard and considered

**4. Speed Over Perfection**
- Timely decisions are better than perfect decisions delayed
- Reversible decisions are made quickly; irreversible decisions are made carefully
- Indecision is a decision (and usually the worst one)

**5. Collaboration Over Hierarchy**
- Seek input from those affected by decision (even if not decision-makers)
- Consensus is ideal but not required (decision-maker has final authority)
- Respect expertise regardless of hierarchy (engineer may know better than executive)

## Decision-Making Process

### Step 1: Identify Decision

**Who:** Anyone (engineer, Delivery Lead, Executive Leadership)

**Actions:**
- Clearly define the decision to be made
- Identify decision category and authority level
- Assess urgency and impact

---

### Step 2: Gather Input

**Who:** Decision-maker (with consultation as required)

**Actions:**
- Consult with relevant stakeholders (delivery team, client, advisors)
- Gather data and context (metrics, feedback, options)
- Identify constraints and trade-offs
- Evaluate options and risks

---

### Step 3: Make Decision

**Who:** Decision-maker (per authority level)

**Actions:**
- Evaluate options and select best course of action
- Document decision and rationale
- Communicate decision to relevant stakeholders
- Assign action items and owners (if applicable)

---

### Step 4: Execute & Monitor

**Who:** Action item owners (with decision-maker oversight)

**Actions:**
- Execute decision and implement actions
- Monitor outcomes and effectiveness
- Adjust as needed (course correction)
- Document lessons learned

---

## Escalation Framework

### When to Escalate

**Escalate Immediately (Same Day):**
- Production incident or outage
- Security breach or vulnerability exploitation
- Client escalation or dissatisfaction
- Team member departure (key person)
- Legal or compliance issue
- Ethical or professional conduct issue

**Escalate Urgently (Within 24-48 Hours):**
- Delivery timeline at risk (cannot meet milestone)
- Scope creep or requirements change (impacts timeline or budget)
- Resource constraint (team capacity insufficient)
- Technical blocker (cannot be resolved by team)
- Dependency failure (third-party vendor or client team)
- Quality issue (critical defects or security vulnerabilities)
- Risk materialization (high-priority risk becomes issue)

**Escalate Routinely (Weekly Review):**
- Emerging risks (not yet critical but require monitoring)
- Process improvements (require approval or resources)
- Resource needs (hiring, training, tools)
- Client feedback (satisfaction or improvement opportunities)

---

### Escalation Process

**Step 1: Identify Issue**

**Who:** Anyone (engineer, Delivery Lead)

**Actions:**
- Clearly define the issue and impact
- Assess urgency and severity
- Determine appropriate escalation path

---

**Step 2: Notify Escalation Target**

**Who:** Person escalating issue

**Actions:**
- Notify escalation target immediately (Slack, phone, email)
- Provide context and options (not just problem statement)
- Specify urgency and requested action

**Escalation Paths:**
- Engineer → Delivery Lead → Executive Leadership → Client Executive
- Delivery Lead → Executive Leadership → Board (if applicable)
- Anyone → Executive Leadership (for critical issues)

---

**Step 3: Convene Review (If Needed)**

**Who:** Escalation target

**Actions:**
- Schedule meeting or call (same day for critical issues)
- Gather relevant stakeholders
- Review issue, options, and recommendations

---

**Step 4: Decide & Communicate**

**Who:** Escalation target (decision authority)

**Actions:**
- Make decision or provide guidance
- Document decision and rationale
- Communicate to relevant stakeholders (team, client)
- Assign action items and owners

---

**Step 5: Follow Up**

**Who:** Escalation target and action item owners

**Actions:**
- Monitor resolution and progress
- Verify completion and effectiveness
- Document lessons learned

---

### Escalation Expectations

**For Person Escalating:**
- Escalate early (do not wait for problem to worsen)
- Provide context and options (not just problem statement)
- Attempt resolution at appropriate level first (do not skip levels unnecessarily)
- Follow up on resolution (do not assume escalation solves problem)

**For Escalation Target:**
- Respond promptly (same day for critical issues)
- Provide clear decision or guidance (not ambiguity)
- Support resolution (provide resources, authority, or intervention)
- Follow up on outcomes (verify resolution)

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Types of Conflicts

**1. Technical Disagreements**
- Engineers disagree on technical approach or architecture
- Delivery Lead and engineer disagree on implementation

**2. Priority Conflicts**
- Multiple engagements compete for same resources
- Quality vs. timeline trade-offs

**3. Scope or Requirements Conflicts**
- Client and delivery team disagree on scope or requirements
- Delivery Lead and Executive Leadership disagree on feasibility

**4. Interpersonal Conflicts**
- Team members have communication or collaboration issues
- Client and delivery team have relationship issues

---

### Conflict Resolution Process

**Step 1: Direct Resolution (Preferred)**

**Who:** Parties in conflict

**Actions:**
- Discuss directly and attempt to resolve
- Focus on facts and outcomes (not personalities)
- Seek common ground and compromise
- Document resolution and move forward

**Timeline:** Same day to 1 week

---

**Step 2: Mediation (If Direct Resolution Fails)**

**Who:** Neutral third party (Delivery Lead, Executive Leadership, or advisor)

**Actions:**
- Facilitate discussion between parties
- Clarify facts and perspectives
- Identify options and trade-offs
- Guide parties to resolution

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

**Step 3: Decision by Authority (If Mediation Fails)**

**Who:** Decision-maker per authority level

**Actions:**
- Hear both sides and gather context
- Evaluate options and trade-offs
- Make decision and explain rationale
- Communicate decision to parties
- Monitor implementation and outcomes

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

### Conflict Resolution Principles

**1. Focus on Outcomes, Not Personalities**
- Conflicts are about decisions and approaches, not personal attacks
- Disagree respectfully and professionally
- Assume good intent (no malice or sabotage)

**2. Seek to Understand Before Being Understood**
- Listen to other perspective before advocating your own
- Ask clarifying questions
- Acknowledge valid points even if you disagree

**3. Escalate When Stuck**
- If direct resolution fails, escalate to mediation or decision authority
- Do not let conflicts fester (they damage morale and delivery)
- Escalation is not failure; it is conflict resolution tool

**4. Move Forward After Decision**
- Once decision is made, commit to execution (even if you disagreed)
- Do not undermine decision or relitigate after the fact
- Provide feedback for future improvement (retrospectives, reviews)
