## Pages That Should NEVER Expose Details

### 🔒 Internal-Only Documents (MUST REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL)

**1. Operating Model & KPIs (`docs/Operating_Model_Overview.md`, `docs/KPI_Framework.md`)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes internal metrics, review cadence, and operational mechanics
- **Public Alternative:** "How We Operate" page signals discipline without metrics
- **Risk of Exposure:** Competitive disadvantage, client misinterpretation of metrics

**2. Succession & Continuity (`docs/Leadership_Succession_Framework.md`, etc.)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes leadership planning, backup authority, emergency protocols
- **Public Alternative:** "Leadership & Governance" page signals governance without specifics
- **Risk of Exposure:** Client concern about stability, competitive intelligence

**3. M&A Readiness (`docs/MA_Readiness_Overview.md`, etc.)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes corporate structure, IP register, integration planning
- **Public Alternative:** None (purely internal strategic planning)
- **Risk of Exposure:** Market speculation, client concern, competitive intelligence

**4. Crisis & Incident Playbooks (`docs/Crisis_Classification_Response.md`, etc.)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes incident response procedures, communication protocols, escalation rules
- **Public Alternative:** Data Privacy page mentions incident response principles
- **Risk of Exposure:** Security vulnerability, client alarm, regulatory scrutiny

**5. Brand Governance (`docs/Brand_Governance_Principles.md`, `docs/Claims_Register.md`, etc.)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes internal controls, prohibited claims, review workflows
- **Public Alternative:** None (purely internal governance)
- **Risk of Exposure:** Perception of over-control, competitive intelligence

**6. Investor & Board Materials (`docs/Investor_Overview.md`, `docs/Board_Narrative.md`, etc.)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes strategic focus, risk awareness, operating metrics structure
- **Public Alternative:** None (purely internal strategic materials)
- **Risk of Exposure:** Market speculation, client concern, competitive intelligence

**7. Decision Rights & Escalation (`docs/Decision_Rights_Escalation.md`, `docs/Authority_Delegation_Matrix.md`)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes decision authority, backup authority, emergency protocols
- **Public Alternative:** "How We Operate" and "Leadership & Governance" signal accountability
- **Risk of Exposure:** Client confusion about who to contact, competitive intelligence

**8. RFP Master & Sales Materials (`docs/Clyros_Tech_RFP_Master.md`, `docs/Clyros_Tech_Sales_Overview.md`)**
- **Why Confidential:** Exposes sales strategy, positioning, and response templates
- **Public Alternative:** Public resources (Company Overview, Delivery Methodology, Engagement Models)
- **Risk of Exposure:** Competitive disadvantage, client perception of "canned" responses

## Gaps & Reinforcement Opportunities

### Gap 1: Resources Not Linked in Footer

**Current State:**  
Public resources (Company Overview, Delivery Methodology, Engagement Models) exist as Markdown but are not linked in footer navigation.

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Resources" link to footer navigation
- Link to `/enterprise` page which displays resource cards
- Generate PDFs from Markdown content for download

**Priority:** High (enables procurement and evaluation)

---

### Gap 2: Enterprise Page Not in Main Navigation

**Current State:**  
Enterprise page exists but is not in main header navigation.

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Enterprise" to main header navigation (between "Delivery Methodology" and "Careers")
- This signals enterprise focus to all visitors
- Alternatively, add under "About" dropdown if header becomes crowded

**Priority:** High (primary authority signal)

---

### Gap 3: How We Operate Not Linked from About

**Current State:**  
"How We Operate" page exists but is not contextually linked from About page.

**Recommendation:**
- Add link to "How We Operate" in About page (e.g., "Learn more about how we operate")
- This provides natural discovery path for interested prospects

**Priority:** Medium (improves navigation and discovery)

---

### Gap 4: No Sitemap Entry for New Pages

**Current State:**  
New pages (`/enterprise`, `/how-we-operate`) are not in sitemap.

**Recommendation:**
- Add `/enterprise` and `/how-we-operate` to `src/app/sitemap.ts`
- Ensures search engine indexing

**Priority:** High (SEO and discoverability)

---

## Navigation Placement Recommendations

### Main Header Navigation (Recommended Order)

**Current:**
1. Home
2. About
3. Services
4. Industries
5. Capabilities
6. Case Studies
7. Partners
8. Delivery Methodology
9. Careers
10. Contact

**Recommended (Add Enterprise):**
1. Home
2. About
3. Services
4. Industries
5. Capabilities
6. Case Studies
7. Partners
8. Delivery Methodology
9. **Enterprise** ← NEW
10. Careers
11. Contact

**Rationale:**  
"Enterprise" page is primary authority signal for CXOs and procurement. Placing it before "Careers" and "Contact" ensures visibility without overcrowding header.

**Alternative (If Header Too Crowded):**
- Create "About" dropdown with: About, How We Operate, Leadership
- Create "Solutions" dropdown with: Services, Industries, Capabilities, Case Studies
- Keep Enterprise in main navigation

---

### Footer Navigation (Recommended Structure)

**Current Legal Nav:**
- Insights
- Global Delivery
- Data Privacy
- Privacy Policy
- Terms
- Company Profile (PDF)

**Recommended (Add Resources):**
- Insights
- Global Delivery
- Data Privacy
- **How We Operate** ← NEW
- **Resources** ← NEW (links to /enterprise#resources)
- Privacy Policy
- Terms
- Company Profile (PDF)

**Rationale:**  
Footer is appropriate for "How We Operate" (deeper operational context) and "Resources" (downloadable materials). Keeps header focused on primary navigation.

## Internal vs. Public Separation Guidelines

### ✅ SAFE TO PUBLISH (Public Authority Signals)

**Characteristics:**
- High-level principles and philosophy
- Outcomes and benefits (not internal mechanics)
- Client-facing processes (status reporting, communication cadence)
- Industry best practices and standards awareness
- Anonymized case studies and examples
- Thought leadership and perspectives

**Examples:**
- "We conduct weekly status reporting" ✅
- "We follow structured delivery methodology with quality gates" ✅
- "We are HIPAA-aware and design systems to support client compliance" ✅
- "We maintain engineering discipline through code review and automated testing" ✅

---

### ❌ NEVER PUBLISH (Internal Operating Systems)

**Characteristics:**
- Specific metrics, KPIs, or targets
- Internal decision rights and authority levels
- Escalation procedures and emergency protocols
- Succession planning and backup authority
- Crisis communication playbooks
- M&A readiness and corporate structure
- Brand governance and claims registers
- RFP templates and sales strategies

**Examples:**
- "Our on-time delivery rate is 87%" ❌
- "Decisions under $5K are approved by Delivery Lead" ❌
- "In emergency, Tier 2 authority activates within 1 hour" ❌
- "We maintain 2-3 internal successors for each critical role" ❌
- "Level 4 crises trigger executive notification within 30 minutes" ❌

---

### ⚠️ GRAY AREA (Requires Judgment)

**Characteristics:**
- Aggregated or anonymized data (e.g., "majority of clients are repeat business")
- General governance statements (e.g., "we have board oversight")
- High-level risk management (e.g., "we identify and escalate risks proactively")
- Quality standards (e.g., "code review is mandatory")

**Guideline:**  
If it demonstrates maturity without exposing competitive intelligence or creating client concern, it's likely safe. When in doubt, err on side of confidentiality.
