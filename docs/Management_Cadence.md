## Management Cadence & Review Rhythm

**Document Classification:** Internal Only – Operational  
**Audience:** Executive Leadership, Delivery Managers, Team Leads  
**Purpose:** Define management review cadence, purpose, and outputs  
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Document Purpose

This document defines Clyros Tech's management cadence: the rhythm of reviews, meetings, and decision-making forums that ensure operational effectiveness and accountability. It provides:
- Review types and frequency
- Purpose and objectives for each review
- Participants and ownership
- Inputs, discussion topics, and outputs

**This document is NOT:**
- A meeting schedule (specific dates and times)
- A substitute for ad-hoc communication and escalation
- A bureaucratic process for its own sake
- External-facing or client-visible

---

## Management Cadence Philosophy

### Principles

**1. Rhythm Over Randomness**
- Predictable cadence creates accountability and discipline
- Regular reviews prevent issues from festering
- Rhythm enables preparation and follow-through

**2. Purpose Over Process**
- Every review has clear purpose and decision authority
- Meetings without purpose or outputs are waste
- Cancel or shorten reviews when not needed (do not meet for sake of meeting)

**3. Escalation Over Delay**
- Do not wait for scheduled review to escalate urgent issues
- Ad-hoc escalation is expected and encouraged
- Scheduled reviews are for routine monitoring, not crisis management

**4. Action Over Discussion**
- Reviews produce decisions and action items (not just discussion)
- Action items have owners and deadlines
- Follow-up on action items is mandatory

**5. Transparency Over Secrecy**
- Information is shared openly (within appropriate audience)
- Bad news is communicated early and honestly
- No surprises in reviews (issues should be known before meeting)

## Review Types & Cadence

### Summary Table

| Review Type | Frequency | Duration | Participants | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Daily Standup | Daily (optional) | 15 min | Delivery team | Coordination and blockers |
| Weekly Operational Review | Weekly | 30-60 min | Delivery Leads + Exec | Active engagements, risks, resources |
| Monthly Delivery & Risk Review | Monthly | 60-90 min | Exec + Delivery Leads | Aggregate performance, trends, improvements |
| Quarterly Strategic Review | Quarterly | 2-3 hours | Exec + Board (if applicable) | Strategic performance, long-term trends |
| Incident Review | As needed | 30-60 min | Relevant stakeholders | Post-incident analysis and corrective actions |
| Retrospective | Post-engagement | 60-90 min | Delivery team + client (optional) | Lessons learned and process improvements |

---

## 1. Daily Standup (Optional)

### Purpose

Coordinate delivery team, identify blockers, and maintain momentum.

**Note:** Daily standups are optional and engagement-specific. Not all engagements require daily sync. Use judgment based on team size, complexity, and coordination needs.

---

### Frequency & Duration

**Frequency:** Daily (typically morning)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes (strict timebox)  
**Format:** In-person, video call, or async (Slack/email)

---

### Participants

- Delivery team (engineers working on engagement)
- Delivery Lead (facilitator)
- Client stakeholders (optional, if value-add)

---

### Agenda & Discussion Topics

**Each team member shares (2-3 minutes max):**
1. **Yesterday:** What did I complete?
2. **Today:** What am I working on?
3. **Blockers:** What is blocking my progress?

**Delivery Lead:**
- Identifies blockers and assigns ownership for resolution
- Escalates issues that cannot be resolved by team
- Adjusts priorities or assignments as needed

---

### Outputs

- Blocker resolution assignments (who will unblock what)
- Priority adjustments (if needed)
- Escalation to Executive Leadership (if needed)

---

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Keep it short and focused (15 minutes max)
- Focus on coordination and blockers (not status reports)
- Resolve blockers immediately or assign ownership
- Cancel if not needed (no work for sake of meeting)

**Don't:**
- Turn into problem-solving session (take offline)
- Allow rambling or detailed technical discussions
- Skip when blockers exist (communicate async if needed)

---

## Action Item Management

### Principles

**1. Every Action Item Has Owner**
- Single person accountable (no shared ownership)
- Owner is responsible for completion (not just coordination)

**2. Every Action Item Has Deadline**
- Specific date (not "soon" or "next week")
- Realistic timeline (do not set up for failure)
- Deadline is commitment (not aspiration)

**3. Action Items Are Tracked**
- Documented in shared system (not just meeting notes)
- Visible to relevant stakeholders
- Reviewed in subsequent meetings

**4. Completion Is Verified**
- Owner confirms completion
- Outcome is verified (not just activity)
- Incomplete items are escalated or re-assigned

---

### Action Item Template

**Format:**
- **Action:** What needs to be done (specific and actionable)
- **Owner:** Who is responsible (single person)
- **Deadline:** When it will be completed (specific date)
- **Status:** Not started / In progress / Completed / Blocked

**Example:**
- **Action:** Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Owner:** [Engineer Name]
- **Deadline:** 2026-02-15
- **Status:** In progress

---

## Meeting Effectiveness
