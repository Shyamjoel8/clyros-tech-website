## 1. PURPOSE OF BRAND GOVERNANCE

Brand governance at Clyros Tech exists to protect the company from reputational, legal, and commercial risk arising from inconsistent, inaccurate, or inappropriate public communication.

This is NOT a marketing initiative. This is a control framework.

### 1.1 Objectives

1. **Legal Protection:** Prevent claims that expose the company to liability or regulatory scrutiny
2. **Credibility Preservation:** Maintain conservative, trustworthy positioning with enterprise buyers
3. **Consistency Enforcement:** Ensure uniform messaging across all touchpoints (website, proposals, hiring)
4. **Quality Control:** Prevent substandard or amateurish communication from reaching clients

### 1.2 Non-Objectives

Brand governance does NOT exist to:
- Generate marketing campaigns
- Create new positioning or slogans
- Produce promotional materials
- Drive "brand awareness" activities

If an initiative is primarily marketing-focused, it is out of scope for this governance framework.

## 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND OWNERSHIP

### 3.1 Executive Leadership

---

## 4. DECISION AUTHORITY

### 4.1 Approval Hierarchy

**Level 1: Pre-Approved**
Content that follows existing templates and approved language requires no additional approval:
- Standard email responses using approved templates
- Job descriptions based on approved formats
- Internal meeting materials not shared externally

**Level 2: Delivery Leadership Approval**
Content that is technical in nature and client-specific:
- SOW descriptions for new engagements (within standard services)
- Technical architecture documentation for clients
- Sprint demo materials and status reports

**Level 3: Executive Leadership Approval (REQUIRED)**
Content that represents the company publicly or contains new claims:
- New website pages or significant page updates
- Sales decks and proposal templates
- Case studies and client references
- Thought leadership articles and blog posts
- Partnership materials and co-marketing content
- Press releases or media interactions
- Conference talks or public presentations

### 4.2 Exceptions and Escalations

**When to Request Exception:**
- Content needs to make a claim not in approved register
- Client requests specific language that differs from standard
- Competitive situation requires faster response than normal review cycle

**How to Request Exception:**
1. Email Executive Leadership with specific request
2. Include rationale and risk assessment
3. Provide proposed language and context
4. Allow 24-48 hours for review (or escalate for urgent situations)

**Exception Denial:**
If an exception is denied, that decision is final. Do NOT:
- Argue or attempt to negotiate
- Create unapproved content anyway
- Route around leadership to get approval elsewhere

---

## 5. ENFORCEMENT EXPECTATIONS

### 5.1 Compliance is Mandatory

Brand governance compliance is not optional. Violations are treated as serious performance or conduct issues.

### 5.2 Violation Categories

**Minor Violations:**
- Using slightly different phrasing than approved templates
- Forgetting to submit content for review (discovered before publication)
- Honest mistakes with no public impact

**Major Violations:**
- Publishing content externally without required approval
- Making prohibited claims in client-facing materials
- Misrepresenting company capabilities or certifications
- Ignoring leadership feedback and publishing anyway

### 5.3 Consequences

**Minor Violations:**
- Coaching and correction
- Requirement to revise and resubmit
- Documentation in performance record (if repeated)

**Major Violations:**
- Formal disciplinary action
- Content retraction and public correction if necessary
- Potential termination for egregious violations (e.g., fraudulent claims)

### 5.4 Positive Reinforcement

Compliance with brand governance is expected, not exceptional. However:
- Teams that consistently follow process without requiring rework will be recognized
- High-quality content that requires minimal revision demonstrates professional maturity
- Leadership will provide clear feedback to help teams improve content quality
