**Last Updated:** January 2026

## 1. Partnership Principles

### 1.1 Strategic Rationale
Clyros Tech pursues partnerships that:
- Expand our technical capabilities or domain expertise
- Enable delivery of more comprehensive client solutions
- Provide access to specialized skills or regional presence
- Enhance our ability to solve complex enterprise problems

We do not pursue partnerships for:
- Volume-based revenue targets
- Market visibility or brand association
- Superficial alliance networks
- Short-term opportunistic gain

### 1.2 Core Principles

**Complementary Capabilities**
Partners bring capabilities that complement rather than duplicate our core strengths. We seek relationships that expand what we can collectively deliver to clients.

**Shared Accountability**
All partners share responsibility for client outcomes. We do not engage in partnerships where accountability is ambiguous or where quality standards diverge.

**Transparent Governance**
Every partnership operates under clear agreements defining roles, responsibilities, decision-making authority, and escalation procedures.

**Client First**
Client interests take precedence over partnership dynamics. If a partnership relationship creates risk or complexity for a client engagement, we address it directly or exit the partnership.

**Long-Term Orientation**
We invest in fewer, deeper relationships rather than maintaining broad networks of superficial alliances. Successful partnerships mature over multiple years and multiple engagements.
