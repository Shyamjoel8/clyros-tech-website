- Family members or associates

**If approached by media, regulators, or external parties:**
1. Do not comment or provide information
2. Refer to Executive Leadership immediately
3. Document the inquiry (who, when, what was asked)
4. Do not say "no comment" (implies guilt or concealment)
5. Say: "I will have [Executive Leadership] contact you directly"

---

## Prohibited Statements

### Never Say or Imply

**1. Speculation About Root Cause**

**Prohibited:**
- "We believe the cause was..."
- "It appears that..."
- "We think the attacker..."
- "This was probably due to..."

**Why:**
- Speculation creates false expectations and liability
- Root cause analysis takes time; premature conclusions are often wrong
- Clients and regulators expect facts, not guesses

**Instead Say:**
- "We are investigating the root cause and will provide updates as facts emerge"
- "Our investigation is ongoing"
- "We will share confirmed findings in our post-incident review"

---

**2. Blame or Fault Assignment**

**Prohibited:**
- "This was [vendor/employee/client]'s fault"
- "If [party] had done [action], this would not have happened"
- "We are not responsible because..."
- "[Party] caused this problem"

**Why:**
- Blame creates legal liability and damages relationships
- Incidents are typically systemic (multiple contributing factors)
- Clients care about resolution, not blame

**Instead Say:**
- "We are investigating all contributing factors"
- "We are focused on resolution and improvement"
- "We take full responsibility for our systems and processes"

---

**3. Promises or Guarantees**

**Prohibited:**
- "This will never happen again"
- "We guarantee..."
- "We will have this resolved by [specific time]"
- "You will not experience any impact"

**Why:**
- Promises create contractual obligations and liability
- Outcomes are uncertain; promises may not be achievable
- Under-promise and over-deliver (not reverse)

**Instead Say:**
- "We are committed to preventing recurrence through [specific actions]"
- "We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible"
- "We expect to have an update by [time]" (not resolution)
- "We are taking all reasonable steps to minimize impact"

---

**4. Minimization or Dismissal**

**Prohibited:**
- "This is not a big deal"
- "This happens all the time"
- "You are overreacting"
- "This is minor compared to..."

**Why:**
- Minimization damages credibility and trust
- Clients determine severity based on their impact (not ours)
- Dismissal implies we do not take concerns seriously

**Instead Say:**
- "We take this matter very seriously"
- "We understand the impact this has on your operations"
- "We are committed to resolving this promptly"

---

**5. Legal Liability or Insurance**

**Prohibited:**
- "We are covered by insurance"
- "Our insurance will pay for damages"
- "We accept liability for..."
- "You can sue us if..."
- "This is covered under our contract"

**Why:**
- Legal and insurance matters are handled by legal counsel only
- Statements about liability can be used against us in litigation
- Contract interpretation is legal matter (not operational)

**Instead Say:**
- "We are working with our legal counsel on all contractual and liability matters"
- "Please direct legal questions to our legal counsel"
- (Do not discuss liability or insurance at all)

---

**6. Confidential or Sensitive Information**

**Prohibited:**
- Client names or details (without permission)
- Specific data or individuals affected (without legal counsel approval)
- Technical details that could aid attackers
- Internal processes or controls (security risk)
- Financial information (revenue, contracts, pricing)

**Why:**
- Confidentiality obligations and legal requirements
- Security risk (technical details aid attackers)
- Competitive risk (internal processes and pricing)

**Instead Say:**
- "We cannot disclose client-specific information"
- "For security reasons, we cannot share technical details"
- "We are working with affected parties directly"

---

**7. Speculation About Legal or Regulatory Consequences**

**Prohibited:**
- "We do not think this requires regulatory notification"
- "This is not a GDPR/HIPAA violation"
- "We will not be fined"
- "The regulator will not care about this"

**Why:**
- Legal and regulatory determinations are made by legal counsel and regulators (not us)
- Speculation creates false expectations and liability
- Regulators determine violations (not companies)

**Instead Say:**
- "We are working with our legal counsel to assess all regulatory obligations"
- "We will comply with all applicable laws and regulations"
- (Do not speculate about regulatory consequences)

---

## Written vs. Verbal Communication

### Preference for Written Communication

**Default:**  
Use written communication (email) for external stakeholders during incidents.

**Rationale:**
- Written communication creates record and reduces misunderstanding
- Allows legal review before sending (reduces liability risk)
- Provides clear documentation for post-incident review
- Reduces risk of misquotation or misremembering

**Application:**
- Initial client notification: Email
- Status updates: Email
- Final notification: Email (comprehensive report)

---

### When to Use Verbal Communication

**Appropriate for:**
- Level 4 crisis (executive-to-executive phone call for urgency)
- Client requests verbal update (accommodate, but follow with written summary)
- Sensitive or emotional matters (verbal is more personal)
- Urgent clarification or decision (phone call faster than email)

**Requirements:**
- Follow up with written summary (document what was discussed)
- Take notes during call (who, when, what was discussed, decisions made)
- Include multiple people on call (witness and support)
- Do not make commitments or promises verbally (confirm in writing)

---

### Verbal Communication Best Practices

**Before Call:**
- Prepare talking points (what to say, what NOT to say)
- Review prohibited statements (this document)
- Have legal counsel on call (for Level 3+ or legal matters)
- Designate note-taker (document discussion)

**During Call:**
- Stick to facts (no speculation)
- Take notes (who said what)
- Do not make promises or commitments (confirm in writing)
- If asked difficult question, say "I will follow up in writing"

**After Call:**
- Send written summary (document discussion)
- Confirm any commitments or next steps (in writing)
- Document in incident log (for post-incident review)

---
