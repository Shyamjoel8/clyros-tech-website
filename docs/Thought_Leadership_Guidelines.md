## 2. Approved Themes

### 2.1 Core Topics
Perspectives should address enduring challenges in enterprise technology:
- Engineering trade-offs and architectural decisions

- Operational reality and production system management
- Governance frameworks and organizational enablers
- Technical debt and long-term system maintainability

### 2.2 Topics to Avoid
Do NOT publish perspectives on:
- Trend-chasing or hype topics ("5 Blockchain Uses for Healthcare")

- Vendor comparisons or product reviews
- Opinions not grounded in direct delivery experience
- Hot takes or controversial positioning for attention

### 2.3 Specific Constraints

- NO exaggeration of impact, scale, or outcomes
- NO discussion of specific client engagements without explicit approval

---

## 3. Tone and Language Rules

### 3.1 Required Tone
- Analytical and evidence-informed
- Calm and reserved
- Boardroom-safe and suitable for regulators
- Acknowledges complexity and trade-offs
- Avoids absolute statements

### 3.2 Prohibited Language
**Never use:**
- Hype words: revolutionary, disruptive, groundbreaking, transformative (used casually)
- Trend language: next-generation, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art
- Superlatives: best, fastest, most advanced, industry-leading
- Fear-based language: urgent, critical, crisis, imperative
- Prescriptive absolutes: must, always, never (in recommendations)

**Use with extreme caution:**
- Should (implies prescription; prefer "organizations may consider")
- Will (implies prediction; prefer "may" or "might")
- Obviously, clearly (implies reader ignorance if they disagree)

### 3.3 Acceptable Phrasing
- "Organizations often observe..."
- "Our experience suggests..."
- "This pattern typically manifests as..."
- "Trade-offs include..."
- "Considerations include..."
- "Evidence from [specific context] indicates..."

## 4. Review and Approval Process

### 4.1 Content Development
1. **Authorship:** Content must be written by senior engineers, architects, or delivery leaders with direct experience in the topic area
2. **Internal Review:** Draft perspectives reviewed by at least two other senior practitioners who can validate claims
3. **Legal/Compliance Review:** All content reviewed for client confidentiality, proprietary information, and regulatory concerns
4. **Executive Approval:** Final approval by executive leadership before publication

### 4.2 Validation Requirements
Before publication, content must satisfy:
- Claims are supportable with specific examples (anonymized if necessary)
- No client-identifiable information or proprietary details
- Tone is consistent with brand positioning (analytical, not promotional)
- No future predictions or trend speculation
- Language is boardroom-safe and regulator-appropriate

### 4.3 Author Attribution
- All perspectives attributed to specific authors (name and role)
- Authors must be Clyros Tech employees with relevant expertise
- No ghostwriting or outsourced content development
- AI tools may assist with drafting but require substantial human authorship and editorial oversight

---

## 5. Publishing Frequency Guidance

### 5.1 Quality Over Volume
- Publish when we have meaningful insights to share, not on schedule
- Better to publish 2-3 high-quality perspectives per year than monthly mediocre content
- Each perspective should reflect genuine lessons learned, not manufactured content

### 5.2 Typical Frequency
- Target: 3-4 substantial perspectives per year
- Minimum length: 800-1200 words (shorter pieces lack analytical depth)
- Maximum length: 2000 words (longer pieces lose focus)

### 5.3 Topic Spacing
- Avoid publishing multiple perspectives on same topic within 6 months
- Maintain diversity across themes (engineering, governance, regulated industries, operational concerns)
- Ensure perspectives complement rather than repeat each other

---

## 6. What NOT to Publish

### 6.1 Prohibited Content Types
- **Listicles:** "7 Ways to Improve Cloud Security" (lacks analytical depth)
- **How-To Tutorials:** Step-by-step technical instructions (not our positioning)
- **Product Reviews:** Comparison of vendors or tools (creates conflicts of interest)
- **Opinion Pieces:** Hot takes or controversial stances for attention
- **News Commentary:** Reactions to current events or industry announcements
- **Case Studies:** Detailed client engagements (reserved for separate format with explicit approval)

### 6.2 Client-Sensitive Topics
Do NOT publish perspectives that:
- Discuss specific client challenges or implementations
- Reference client industries, geographies, or organizational details that could enable identification
- Disclose proprietary methods, frameworks, or competitive differentiators
- Address ongoing client engagements or projects

### 6.3 Competitive Positioning
Avoid:
- Explicit or implicit criticism of competitors
- Claims of superiority or market leadership
- Comparison of approaches or methodologies
- Positioning that creates defensive posture

---

## 7. Distribution and Promotion

### 7.1 Primary Channel
- Perspectives published on website at `/insights/[slug]`
- Listed on insights overview page with brief summaries
- Included in sitemap for search indexing

### 7.2 Secondary Distribution
- Email notification to opt-in subscriber list (if/when established)
- LinkedIn posts linking to full perspectives (reserved tone, no hype)
- Direct sharing with clients or prospects when contextually relevant

### 7.3 What We Do NOT Do
- Social media campaigns or promotional pushes
- Paid promotion or advertising of content
- SEO optimization techniques that compromise content quality

## 8. Metrics and Evaluation

### 8.1 Success Criteria
Perspectives succeed when they:
- Generate substantive inquiries from qualified prospects
- Earn respect from technical peers and industry practitioners
- Contribute to positioning Clyros Tech as analytical and serious

### 8.2 What We Do NOT Measure
- Page views or traffic volume
- Social media shares or engagement metrics

We publish for credibility and demonstration of capability, not for marketing funnel metrics.

### 9.1 Content Lifecycle

- If circumstances change significantly, publish new perspective rather than updating old one
