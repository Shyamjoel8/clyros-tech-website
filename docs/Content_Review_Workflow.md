## Content & Asset Review Workflow

**Document Classification:** Internal Use Only  
**Audience:** All personnel creating external-facing content  
**Purpose:** Define step-by-step process for content creation, review, and approval  
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## 1. PURPOSE & SCOPE

### 1.1 Why This Workflow Exists

Content review exists to:
- **Prevent Risk:** Catch prohibited claims, legal issues, and accuracy problems before publication
- **Ensure Quality:** Maintain consistent voice, tone, and professionalism
- **Protect Brand:** Preserve credibility and trust with clients and candidates
- **Enable Efficiency:** Provide clear process so content creators know what to expect

### 1.2 When Review is REQUIRED

**Review is MANDATORY for:**
- All public website content (new pages or updates to existing pages)
- Sales decks, proposals, and RFP responses
- Case studies and client reference materials
- Job descriptions and hiring materials
- Partnership materials and co-marketing content
- Thought leadership articles (insights, blog posts)
- Social media posts (company LinkedIn account)
- Email templates for external use
- Downloadable assets (white papers, company profile, guides)
- Conference presentations or public talks

**Review is NOT required for:**
- Internal documentation (engineering docs, runbooks, technical specs)
- Internal communications (employee emails, Slack messages, team meetings)
- Client-specific technical deliverables (SOW work products, code, architecture docs for specific projects)
- Personal LinkedIn posts by employees (unless explicitly representing company position)
- Private 1:1 client emails using approved templates

**When in Doubt:** Submit for review. Better to over-review than under-review.

## 2. CONTENT CREATION WORKFLOW (STEP-BY-STEP)

### STEP 1: Pre-Creation Planning

**Before writing, answer:**
1. **What is this content's purpose?** (Inform, persuade, instruct, attract)
2. **Who is the audience?** (CXO, procurement, technical architect, candidate)
3. **What claims will I need to make?** (Check `Claims_Register.md`)
4. **What is the publication target?** (Website, deck, proposal, email)
5. **What is the deadline?** (Allow sufficient review time)

**Review Required Documents:**
- **Voice, Tone & Language Rules** (`Voice_Tone_Language_Rules.md`)
- **Claims Register** (`Claims_Register.md`)
- **Existing approved content** for reference and consistency

**Timeline Planning:**
- Simple content (email template, job description): 2-3 business days
- Medium content (case study, deck slide updates): 5-7 business days
- Complex content (new website page, thought leadership article): 10-14 business days

### STEP 2: Content Drafting

**During drafting:**
- Follow approved voice and tone guidelines
- Use only approved claims (or mark new claims for review)
- Reference existing approved content for consistency
- Self-check against prohibited language
- Include sources/evidence for factual claims

**Self-Review Checklist (before submission):**
- [ ] No superlatives ("best," "leading," "world-class")
- [ ] No false certifications or compliance claims
- [ ] No buzzwords ("disruptive," "innovative," "transformative")
- [ ] Professional tone (not casual or promotional)
- [ ] Specific and concrete (not vague or abstract)
- [ ] Factually accurate and verifiable
- [ ] Consistent with existing approved content

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use clear headings and structure
- Break into readable sections
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include context notes for reviewer (if needed)

### STEP 3: Submission for Review

**How to Submit:**
1. **Email Executive Leadership** with subject: "Content Review: [Type] - [Brief Description]"
2. **Attach or link to content** (Google Doc, Markdown file, PDF, etc.)
3. **Include context:**
   - Purpose and audience
   - Where this will be published/used
   - Deadline (if applicable)
   - Any specific concerns or questions
4. **Self-assessment:** Note where you applied governance rules and any areas of uncertainty

**Submission Format Options:**
- Google Doc (with comment permissions)
- Markdown file in GitHub repository (PR or direct file)
- Email body (for short content like email templates)
- PDF (for finalized design assets requiring approval)

**Response Time Expectations:**
- **Simple content:** 1-2 business days
- **Medium content:** 3-5 business days
- **Complex content:** 5-10 business days
- **Urgent requests:** Escalate via phone/Slack, allow minimum 24 hours

### STEP 4: Review Process (Internal - What Reviewer Does)

**Executive Leadership Reviews For:**
1. **Claims Compliance:** All claims approved or marked for approval
2. **Voice & Tone:** Consistent with brand guidelines
3. **Accuracy:** Factual correctness and verifiability
4. **Legal Risk:** No liability-creating language
5. **Strategic Alignment:** Consistent with company positioning

**Review Outcomes:**
- **Approved:** Content may be published as-is
- **Approved with Minor Edits:** Reviewer makes small changes, notifies creator
- **Revision Required:** Specific feedback provided, creator must revise and resubmit
- **Rejected:** Content not aligned with brand, major rework or abandonment required

### STEP 5: Revision & Resubmission (if required)

**If revision required:**
1. **Read feedback carefully** and understand reasoning
2. **Make ALL requested changes** (do NOT skip or argue)
3. **Highlight changes** in resubmission (use comments, track changes, or notes)
4. **Resubmit with subject:** "Content Review RESUBMIT: [Type] - [Brief Description]"
5. **Include summary:** Brief note on what was changed

**Resubmission Timeline:**
- Minor revisions: 1-2 business days for re-review
- Major revisions: 3-5 business days for re-review

**Multiple Revision Cycles:**
- Most content should pass within 1-2 revision cycles
- If content requires 3+ cycles, schedule discussion with reviewer to align on expectations

### STEP 6: Final Approval & Publication

**Upon receiving "Approved" confirmation:**
1. **Publish content** to intended destination (website, deck library, email template repo, etc.)
2. **Archive approved version** for reference
3. **Notify stakeholders** if content was requested by others (e.g., sales team, hiring manager)
4. **Document publication date** (for future update tracking)

**Publication Responsibilities:**
- Website content: Developer or content manager publishes via Git
- Sales decks: Business development saves to approved deck library
- Job descriptions: Hiring manager posts to job boards
- Email templates: Save to shared template repository

### STEP 7: Post-Publication Monitoring

**After publication:**
- Monitor for client/candidate feedback or questions
- Track performance or engagement (if applicable)
- Report any issues or inaccuracies to Executive Leadership
- Plan periodic review for content updates (see Section 5)

---

## 3. EXPEDITED REVIEW PROCESS (URGENT SITUATIONS)

### 3.1 When Expedited Review is Appropriate

**Valid reasons for expedited review:**
- Active RFP with firm deadline
- Client request with short turnaround
- Time-sensitive job posting for critical role
- Urgent partner collaboration opportunity

**NOT valid reasons:**
- Poor planning or missed deadlines
- Desire to publish quickly without justification
- Avoiding standard review process

### 3.2 How to Request Expedited Review

**Email Executive Leadership with subject: "URGENT Content Review: [Type]"**

Include:
1. **Reason for urgency:** Specific deadline and consequences of missing it
2. **Content attachment:** Ready for immediate review
3. **Risk assessment:** What could go wrong if we rush?
4. **Fallback plan:** What happens if urgent review isn't possible?

**Response Time:**
- Target: 4-8 business hours
- May not always be possible (e.g., weekend, leadership travel)
- If not possible, Leadership will propose alternative timeline

### 3.3 Expedited Review Trade-Offs

**What to expect with expedited review:**
- Faster turnaround but potentially less comprehensive feedback
- Higher bar for approval (err on side of rejection if uncertain)
- May require follow-up standard review after publication

**Creator Responsibilities:**
- Ensure content quality is high before submission (no sloppy drafts)
- Accept feedback decisively (no time for multiple revisions)
- Be prepared for "not approved" outcome if content has issues

## 5. PERIODIC CONTENT REVIEW & UPDATES

### 5.1 Why Periodic Review Matters

Content becomes outdated as:
- Company capabilities evolve
- Regulatory environment changes
- Competitive landscape shifts
- Best practices and technologies advance

### 5.2 Review Frequency by Content Type

| Content Type | Review Frequency | Owner |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Homepage & key pages | Quarterly | Executive Leadership |
| Service descriptions | Bi-annual | Delivery Leadership |
| Case studies | Annual (or when client relationship changes) | Business Development |
| Job descriptions | Per posting cycle (or annual if evergreen) | Hiring Manager |
| Sales decks | Quarterly | Business Development |
| Thought leadership | No review (time-stamped and archived) | N/A |
| Email templates | Annual | Content creator |
| Legal pages (Privacy, Terms) | Annual or as regulations change | Executive Leadership + Legal |

### 5.3 Periodic Review Process

**Trigger:**
- Calendar reminder based on review frequency
- Significant company change (new service, new market)
- Competitive or regulatory change requiring update

**Process:**
1. Content owner reviews existing content
2. Identifies outdated claims, inaccuracies, or missing information
3. Drafts updates following standard workflow (Steps 2-6)
4. Submits for review with note: "Periodic Update: [Content]"
5. Implements approved updates

**Archival:**
- Old versions archived for reference
- Major changes documented with rationale
- Publication date updated

## 6. EXCEPTION HANDLING

### 6.1 When Standard Workflow Doesn't Fit

**Scenarios:**
- Client requires specific language not in approved claims
- Competitive situation requires faster response
- External partner has co-marketing requirements
- Regulatory submission has prescribed format

**How to Handle:**
1. **Do NOT bypass review** even in exceptional circumstances
2. **Escalate to Executive Leadership** immediately with full context
3. **Provide rationale** for why exception is needed
4. **Propose specific language** or approach
5. **Accept decision** (approved, approved with modifications, or denied)

### 6.2 Co-Created Content (with Partners or Clients)

**Workflow:**
1. **Initial draft** created collaboratively with partner/client
2. **Clyros Tech reviews** for brand compliance and claims accuracy
3. **Feedback provided** to partner/client (with rationale)
4. **Negotiate** if partner/client pushes back on changes
5. **Escalate to Executive Leadership** if cannot reach agreement
6. **Final approval** required before publication

**Non-Negotiable Elements:**
- Cannot make false certification claims
- Cannot misrepresent company structure or scale
- Cannot violate legal or regulatory requirements
- Can negotiate on tone, phrasing, emphasis

### 6.3 Violations Discovered Post-Publication

**If inaccurate or non-compliant content is published:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Notify Executive Leadership** immediately
2. **Assess impact:** Who has seen it? What is the risk?
3. **Determine correction approach:**
   - **Minor:** Update content quietly
   - **Major:** Retract and issue correction
   - **Severe:** Legal consultation and public correction

**Follow-Up:**
1. Root cause analysis (how did this happen?)
2. Process improvement (how to prevent recurrence?)
3. Personnel accountability (if violation was intentional or negligent)
4. Documentation in governance incident log
