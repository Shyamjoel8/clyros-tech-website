## Authority Delegation & Continuity Matrix

**Document Classification:** Internal Only – Board Governance  
**Audience:** Board of Directors, Executive Leadership, Delivery Managers  
**Purpose:** Define decision authority, backup authority, and escalation paths  
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Document Purpose

This document defines Clyros Tech's authority delegation matrix: who has authority to make which decisions, who serves as backup, and how decisions escalate. It provides:
- Decision categories and authority levels
- Primary and backup authority for each decision type
- Escalation paths when primary authority unavailable
- Documentation requirements

**This document is NOT:**
- A substitute for judgment and collaboration
- A rigid hierarchy preventing communication
- External-facing or client-visible
- A guarantee that all scenarios are covered (use judgment for edge cases)

---

## Matrix Purpose & Principles

### Purpose

**Business Continuity:**  
Ensure decisions can be made without delay, even when primary authority is unavailable (vacation, illness, departure, emergency).

**Clarity:**  
Eliminate ambiguity about who decides what. Reduce decision paralysis and conflict.

**Accountability:**  
Clear authority creates clear accountability. Those with authority are accountable for outcomes.

**Efficiency:**  
Decisions are made at appropriate level (not unnecessarily escalated or delayed).

---

### Principles

**1. Authority Matches Responsibility**
- Those accountable for outcomes have authority to make decisions
- Authority is delegated to lowest appropriate level (not centralized unnecessarily)

**2. Backup Authority is Pre-Defined**
- For all critical decisions, backup authority is designated
- No delay in decision-making when primary authority unavailable

**3. Escalation is Clear**
- Escalation path is defined for each decision type
- Escalate when decision exceeds authority level or requires broader input

**4. Documentation is Required**
- Significant decisions are documented (rationale, alternatives, outcomes)
- Documentation enables learning, accountability, and continuity

**5. Judgment is Expected**
- Matrix provides guidance, not rigid rules
- Use judgment for edge cases or unique situations
- Escalate when uncertain about authority

## Escalation Paths

### When to Escalate

**Escalate Immediately:**
- Decision exceeds your authority level (per matrix)
- Decision has significant risk or impact (client, financial, legal, reputational)
- Decision requires broader input or consensus
- Uncertainty about authority or appropriate action
- Emergency or crisis situation

**Do NOT Escalate:**
- Decisions within your authority level (make decision and document)
- Routine operational decisions (use judgment)
- Decisions that can wait for regular review (weekly, monthly)

---

### How to Escalate

**Step 1: Prepare Context**
- Clearly define decision to be made
- Provide relevant context (background, constraints, urgency)
- Identify options and trade-offs
- Recommend course of action (if appropriate)

**Step 2: Notify Escalation Target**
- Contact escalation target immediately (Slack, phone, email)
- Specify urgency (immediate, urgent, routine)
- Request decision or guidance

**Step 3: Document Decision**
- Once decision is made, document rationale and outcome
- Communicate decision to relevant stakeholders
- Implement decision and monitor outcomes

---

### Escalation Timelines

**Immediate (Within 1 Hour):**
- Level 4 crises or emergencies
- Client escalations or dissatisfaction
- Legal or regulatory issues
- Financial emergencies

**Urgent (Within 4 Hours):**
- Level 3 incidents
- Major delivery risks or issues
- Significant financial decisions (> $25K)

**Routine (Within 1 Business Day):**
- Level 2 incidents
- Strategic or commercial decisions (no immediate urgency)
- Routine escalations (weekly review)

---

## Backup Authority Activation

### When Backup Authority Applies

**Primary Authority Unavailable:**
- Vacation or time off (planned absence)
- Illness or personal emergency (unplanned absence)
- Departure or transition (permanent absence)
- Conflict of interest (primary authority cannot decide)

**Primary Authority Declines:**
- Primary authority delegates to backup (explicitly)
- Primary authority requests escalation (explicitly)

---

### How to Activate Backup Authority

**Step 1: Verify Primary Authority Unavailable**
- Attempt to contact primary authority (phone, email, Slack)
- If no response within reasonable time (1-4 hours depending on urgency), proceed to backup

**Step 2: Contact Backup Authority**
- Notify backup authority of situation (primary unavailable, decision needed)
- Provide context and request decision

**Step 3: Document**
- Document that primary authority was unavailable
- Document backup authority decision and rationale
- Notify primary authority when they return (for awareness)

---

### Backup Authority Limitations

**Backup authority should NOT:**
- Make irreversible strategic decisions (without primary authority or Board approval)
- Commit to long-term contracts or obligations (without primary authority or Board approval)
- Make major organizational changes (hiring, firing, restructuring)

**Backup authority SHOULD:**
- Make routine operational decisions (day-to-day continuity)
- Make time-sensitive decisions (cannot wait for primary authority)
- Escalate to Board if decision exceeds backup authority level

---
