## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can engagement model change mid-project?

Yes, with mutual agreement. For example, project-based engagement can transition to time & materials if scope evolves significantly, or time & materials can convert to dedicated team for long-term partnership.

---

### What happens if scope changes during project-based engagement?

Scope changes are managed through formal change control process:
1. Change request submitted
2. Impact assessment (timeline, budget, risk)
3. Client review and approval
4. Delivery plan updated
5. Change implemented and tracked

Significant scope changes may require contract amendment.

---

### Can we start with small engagement before committing long-term?

Yes. Many clients start with discovery or proof-of-concept engagement (4-8 weeks) before committing to full implementation. This allows both parties to assess fit and alignment.

---

### Do you require minimum engagement duration?

- Project-Based: No minimum (but typically 3+ months for meaningful work)
- Time & Materials: No minimum (but typically 3+ months)
- Dedicated Team: Yes, typically 6-12 month minimum commitment
- Advisory Retainer: Typically 3-6 month minimum

---

### Can we pause or terminate engagement early?

Terms vary by engagement type and are defined in contract. Typically:
- Project-Based: Early termination requires payment for work completed plus termination fee
- Time & Materials: 30-day notice period (typical)
- Dedicated Team: 60-90 day notice period (typical)
- Advisory Retainer: 30-day notice period (typical)

---

### Do you provide warranties or guarantees?

We provide standard professional services warranties (work performed with reasonable care and skill). We do not provide outcome guarantees or SLA-based warranties for fixed-price work.

For production support and managed services, SLAs can be negotiated separately.
