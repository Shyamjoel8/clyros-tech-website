## WHO WE ARE

**Positioning:**  
Clyros Tech operates at the intersection of rigorous engineering practice and enterprise delivery discipline. We are not a body shop, staffing agency, or generalist consultancy. We build, integrate, and modernize systems that must work correctly under production load.

**Core Values:**
- **Engineering Rigor:** Code quality, testing, documentation, and operational readiness are not optional
- **Transparency:** Clients receive continuous visibility into progress, risks, and decisions
- **Accountability:** We own outcomes, not just deliverables
- **Long-Term Thinking:** We build systems designed for evolution, not disposal

**Headquarters:**  
India (distributed delivery model with international client support)

**International Reach:**  
We serve clients in United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through distributed delivery models that accommodate timezone requirements and regulatory contexts.

## TRUST & COMPLIANCE

### Data Privacy & Security

**Not Certified:** Clyros Tech is not certified under GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, or other regulatory frameworks. We design practices to support client compliance obligations.

**Data Protection Principles:**
- Data minimization (collect only what's necessary)
- Purpose limitation (use data only for specified purposes)
- Confidentiality (NDAs govern all client data)
- Retention policies (data returned or destroyed at engagement conclusion)

**Cross-Border Data Handling:**
- Standard Contractual Clauses for EU data transfers
- Data Processing Agreements for GDPR compliance
- Business Associate Agreements for HIPAA contexts
- Data residency options (client-controlled infrastructure)

**Security Controls:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Multi-factor authentication for system access
- Regular security assessments and vulnerability management
- Incident detection and response procedures

### Compliance Alignment

**Delivery aligned with ISO-grade practices** (not ISO-certified)  
**HIPAA-aware engineering for healthcare contexts** (not HIPAA-certified)  
**SOC 2–aligned security and controls** (not SOC 2-certified)

Language is carefully phrased to avoid implying certifications we do not hold while communicating our capability to support client compliance obligations.
